            <small>Bangladesh ended their South Africa tour with mixed feelings. <abbr title="Agence France-Presse"><mark>AFP</mark></abbr></small>

        <p align="center">All in all&comma; how much would you give the Bangladesh team for the South Africa <br>tour out of 10&quest; Those who are thinking more about how it ended are unlikely to <br>give high marks. After such a dismal performance in the Test series, why should <br>they dole out any marks at all&#33;</p>
        <p align="center">But what if you take the <abbr title="One Day International">ODI</abbr> series into account&quest; Bangladesh didn’t have a single <br>victory in South African soil against South Africa before. But this time they won <br>an entire series, that too against a full strength South Africa side&excl; They lost the <br>second <abbr title="One Day International">ODI</abbr> but that was on a wicket at Johannesburg which the South African <br>cricket experts themselves termed very difficult. So, if you don’t give Tamim <br>Iqbal’s team <b>10 out of 10</b> then you are definitely not a fair examiner.</p>

        <p align="center">It’s not like the team shouldn’t get any marks for the Test series either. Recall <br>the first Test in Durban one more time. Till the fourth day’s afternoon, did <br>anyone think Bangladesh would lose the match by a mammoth <i>220</i> runs&quest; Before <br>Bangladesh’s second innings, both South Africa and Bangladesh had equal <br>hopes of winning. Anyways, when has Bangladesh ever played good Test cricket <br>in that country&excl; If you don’t evaluate an entire Test on the basis of just one <br>innings, you have no reason not to give Bangladesh <em>7&#47;8 out of 10</em>.</p>
        <p align="center">Now let’s talk about the Port Elizabeth Test. In one word, Bangladesh played <br>terrible cricket. Terrible batting on both innings almost made us forget how <br>brilliantly the South Africa tour had begun&excl; The last Test has casted a dark <br>shadow over the tour’s report card. But not taking the <abbr title="One Day International">ODI</abbr> series and the first <br>Test into account while giving the marks won’t be fair.</p>

        <p align="center">Bangladesh has been a good team in white ball cricket for the last few years. <br>Especially at home soil, for them there is not much difference between having <br>Zimbabwe or teams like India, Australia as opponents. The match invariablybr <br>ends in a win or defeat, but Bangladesh now has learnt to believe themselves as <br>winners till the fat lady sings. This change in mentality is something to be <br>celebrated. Bangladesh will need more time to reach this position in Tests. And <br>that’s just not because of the ability or the lack of which of the cricketers. Just <br>like the players, Bangladesh itself still hasn’t adjusted to red-ball cricket. Test <br>cricket history, Test culture and domestic structure have a link with <br>performance in <strong>red-ball</strong> cricket. Hoping that a tree would bear flowers and fruits <br>in abundance without its roots first reaching deep into the soil and it being <br>properly watered is a bit hyperbolic.</p>
        <p align="center">Even after tearing apart the Bangladesh team with criticism for getting bowled <br><strong>out for 53 and 80</strong>, we have to accept that Bangladesh still has a long way to go <br>before they can find regular success in Test cricket. In Tests, they will seldom <br>play well, win or draw a game– we must have the mentality to accept this as <br> proof of their progress and accept their defeats.</p>

                <q>For whatever reason, many of them now believe that no matter <br>what they do, even if they get all <strong>out for 53 and 80</strong>, they can’t be <br>criticised for it. They welcome praise for playing well but find <br>criticism for playing poorly unacceptable and ramblings of people <br>who don’t understand cricket.</q>

        <p align="center">Still, there is criticism and that results from the people’s expectations from the <br> cricketers. These same cricketers play well and make us dream of bigger wins. <br>Then when they bat childishly and get <strong>out for 53 and 80</strong>, it’s bound to hurt <br>the fans. But how much do the cricketers keep note of the hurt felt by the cricket <br>fans&quest; Do they know that this hurt comes from the love people have for this <br>game&quest; Everyone’s criticism won’t follow cricketing logic and that’s expected. <br>But the reaction comes only from one thing, the hope of getting results from the <br>cricketers they love.</p>
        <p align="center">Seeing this byproduct of love from an antagonistic point of view seems to be the <br>biggest problem of the Bangladesh cricketers at the moment. They are showing <br>maturity in on-field performances, but are still immature in this aspect. For <br>whatever reason, many of them now believe that no matter what they do, even if <br>they get all <strong>out for 53 and 80</strong>, they can’t be criticised for it. They welcome praise <br>for playing well but find criticism for playing poorly unacceptable and ramblings <br>of people who don’t understand cricket.</p>

        <p align="center">Even people who accompany the cricketers are doubtful of how much the <br>players feel remorse after performing poorly. After making a mistake on the <br>field, the cricketers are more curious about what the people are saying, the <br>media is writing and the people on Facebook are saying rather than what the <br>coach has to say. Inside the team, those criticisms get counter-criticism, which <br>negatively affects the young cricketers. They get taught that national team <br>cricketers are above all accountability. Their lack of interest to return the fans <br>greetings with a cursory glance is shocking!</p>
        <p align="center">But not all cricketers can be blamed for this. There are always some exceptions,<br> who find inspiration even from criticism. They know, that cricket in Bangladesh <br>is a love affair. There will be hurt and also repentance to end the hurt.</p>
